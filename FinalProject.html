<p>As the king of the gods Zeus is considered the most powerful of all the Olympian gods. When he and his brothers: Poseidon and Hades drew lots to see who 
    would be ruler of each domain, Zeus drew the sky. Zeus is the ruler of the sky, <br> able to control thunder and what he is most well known for; lightning. <br>
    Zeus came into power when he defeated his father; Kronos, Titan of time. His father did not want to lose power and so every child himself and his wife Rhea had, he ate.  <br>
    Since the gods are immortal, these children were alive inside Kronos' stomach until Zeus, their youngest brother who had been substituted as a rock by his mother when he was born to escape being eaten by his father, <br>
    fed Kronos a mixture of mustard and wine. <br> 
    This concoction made Kronos puke up his siblings, and a fight ensued, ending with Zeus and his siblings' victory over their father.

<p>Although the sister of Zeus, godly relationships do not work in the same manner as humans, and so Zeus and Hera married, just as their parents; Kronos and Rhea were siblings before them.<br> 
    Hera is known as the Goddess of marriage which is quite unfortunate considering her husband is the most well-known entity in Greek Mythology for cheating. <br>
    Together, Hera and Zeus had many children, including the Olympian gods Ares, God of War, and Hepheastus, God of the Forge.<br>
    Hera is well known for her jealousy and revenge against the many lovers of Zeus, often cursing the women with punishments, even if Zeus' advances were not welcome.

    He is a master of all weapons, and one of the most formidable of the gods. Ares has been known to start conflicts throughout time just for the sake of bloodshed. <br>
    It is believed he enjoys starting conflict between family memebrs the most, as there is nothing messier than blood spilt between family.  <br>
    Ares has a relationship with Aphrodite, Goddess of Love, despite her marriage to his brother, Hepheastus, God of the Forge.

<p>When Aphrodite came into existence is not agreed upon in every story. Some scholars say she is the daughter of Zeus and a diety, others claim she is the true oldest of all the gods<br>
    as she sprung from the waves when Kronos desposed of the body of his father, Ouranos in the Ocean. <br>
    Regardless of her birthplace, Aphrodite is the goddess of love, and is married to Hepheastus, God of the Forge. Despite this marriage, Aphrodite has many other relationships<br>
    including on with Ares, God of War. This may be due to the disconfiguration of her husbands' appearance.
